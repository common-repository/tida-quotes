Show Customized Quotes in WordPress Admin Dashboard

== Description ==

<strong>Tida Quotes</strong> is a plugin that allows you to display your quotes or sentences in your WordPress dashboard. This plugin is actually a customization of the Hello Dolly plugin and is displayed in the WordPress dashboard beside the 'Screen Options' or 'Help' Tab. We've added the name of <a href="http://ma.tt" target="_blank"><strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong></a>, the main contributor to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/" target="_blank"><strong>Hello Dolly<strong></a> plugin, as a tribute to his contribution to the plugin. Of course, it is better to name this plugin: Advanced Hello Dolly or Customized Hello Dolly.

If you also want to add your favorite collection of sentences to the Import data list, just send us an <a href="mailto:info@tidaweb.com">email</a>.
